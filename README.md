# 🍒 Riikka Lilja-Niemi

**`Coder, SEO specialist and visual designer`**

I am a fast-learning coder with many years of experience working in e-commerce and marketing. My passion is creating user-friendly web applications. I use React to create modern and interactive web applications that seamlessly combine visuals and functionality into user interfaces that support the brand.

As an SEO specialist, I have the ability to combine technical development and Search Engine Optimization already in the early stages of planning, which helps to increase the visibility of digital solutions. I am looking for opportunities to develop as part of an innovative team and bring value with both customer-oriented design and technical expertise. I get excited about problem solving and, with my SEO expertise, also about data analysis.

🔮 Fun fact: I thought coding was magic that I could never learn. Fortunately, I was wrong. ✨✨
